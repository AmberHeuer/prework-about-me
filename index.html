      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>At the very start, let me say that we both have something in common. You don’t know what I’m going to say… and neither do I. 
      <p>I've been described as a "squirrel on acid" and while I can't say I have anything to compare to test the validity of that statement I can say with certainty that my life is a joke, so I’m naturally funny. 
      <p>If, however, you find me smiling, you should be scared. 
      <p>TL;DR sunshine mixed with a little hurricane, and a hapless Environmental Science student.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Monkey Bottoms</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>While i really enjoy minding my own business, I love Ziplines, but I'm also quite fond of any outdoor adventures really.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>A job dreaming. For now though anything that allows me to create or explore new things within the abiotic sphere of the environment, and allows me to travel, ideally to remote places.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Monkey Bottoms Burrow</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Besides the ability to make me an A-grade spider, I want to combine the skills of a web developer into my current field and hopefully open some unique avenues for myself.</p>
